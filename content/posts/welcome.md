## Blog Under Construction

Welcome! My technical blog is currently being set up. I'm preparing exciting content across:

- **Technical Insights** - Deep dives into coding, software architecture, and best practices
- **Project Showcases** - Sharing my personal and professional projects
- **Startup Journey** - Devlog and insights from building my own startup
- **Development Tutorials** - Step-by-step guides and howtos
- **Freelancing Tips** - Knowledge from my freelancing experience
- **Decentralized Protocols** - A protocol I created for certificate-based delegation of authority over data and operations across system boundaries

**The first real post will be coming soon!** Stay tuned for regular updates and insights.
